# bdp2bmp
Graphics files for Matthews Swedot Jet-A-Mark inkjet printing systems are interpreted text files with the pixels encoded in hexadecimal stings. This utility will translate the Matthews native .bdp file into a .bmp image file.

Where do we go from here? It would be nice to make a graphical interface that would allow users to browse for the target file and display the translated image on the screen. It would be really nice to be able to automatically display the corresponding images from all .bdp files in a directory!
